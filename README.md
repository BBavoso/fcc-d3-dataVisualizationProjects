# D3 Data Visualization Portfolio

This project is a collection of the 5 projects that are a part of freeCodeCamp's Data Visualization Certification. I used D3 in order to create the visualizations in this project. I also used this opportunity to better learn and understand vanilla JavaScript as most my other web projects have been TypeScript and React.

This Project Contains 5 seperate demonstrations of D3 Visualizations

1. Bar Chart
1. Scatterplot Graph
1. Heat Map
1. Choropleth Map
1. Treemap Diagram

## Tests

The tests (provided by freeCodeCamp's curriculum) can be activated on the top left by selecting the correct test for the project
